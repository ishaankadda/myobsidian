# A brief on the new repo
This new repo at `/nfs/ishaan/yolov7_ishaan/yolov7` allows quicker ablation studies.
1. models no longer need to be defined in `.yaml`, you can define them purely in Pytorch.
2. provided a small training wrapper that can run training on a folder of configs.
3. Ability to create models and specify the activation used for routing inside the config itself. (done for the old .yaml repo, will get a pure pytorch implementation soon.)
