When dealing with accusations or insults, understand that it most likely comes from what she is feeling right now. 

The most common response to this is to prove yourself otherwise, logically. This rarely works, because an accusation must be accepted before it is addressed. You **must not REACT** to her accusation, unless it is well-founded.

Append the words "I feel" and "Right now", mentally, to the beginning and end of her accusation. Understand that most of her turmoil will come from a place of feeling and emotion and is temporary, and it will likely pass soon.
