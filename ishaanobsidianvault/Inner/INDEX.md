The code I have chosen to abide by. The parts that I have chosen to become. Towards the creation of my life's work.

# What is my Superior Man?
My superior man is self-directed, masterful and powerful. 

He lives his life confidently, directed towards his purpose.

Reality warps around him as he walks through it unfazed. Impossible odds bend to his strength and intelligence.

He posesses and displays mastery over **body**, **work**, **money**, and **social interaction** in every action.

He is a jacked, actualized philosopher king.

He has limitless energy and he finds and bleeds to his edge at every breath.

His mastery over finding and living his edge is so superior that he lives in a constant state of flow at the threshold of his limits. His energy is abundant and limitless and it sustains him at his edge.
