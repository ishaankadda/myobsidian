# Principles
1. **Create and Establish thought leadership** - FuseNets should attract the  research talents and foster an ecosystem of
2. **Create thought leadership** - FuseNets aims to establish itself among the hottest frameworks being used to build and train new stuff.
3. **Create ??**


# General Idea
FuseNets will be a platform to automate the entire pipeline of developing and deploying computer vision models and tasks for individual researchers and companies alike. It will work with a yaml interface in order to compose not just models, but tasks together. All individual task types will have a common interface for inter-communication and composing the tasks together.
