todo for today:

-------------------------------------
 1. VIOLENCE
- ~~plot persons, tubes, and the circles between them. label the person id and find a way to make this more reliable.~~
- ~~figure out a way to find a good threshold. This must involve clips from entire videos~~ -> <span class='red'>run `utils/tube2.py` directly with the `--debug` flag to generate tests on 12 collected videos.</span>
- ~~implement the final result into testbench, reorganise adn run all results and present to Manish ~~
- interpret results and figure out the most promising direction forward.
- present to manish
- add cache-directory=None ability.
- triage below tasks after suggesting to manish
- implement sovminusso separately - think how.
- implement more models and more benhmarking
- implement auto sheet generation

-------------------------------------
2. TOKENIZER
- finish debugging the implementation for the tokenizer. if it doesnt work, make a simpler one.

-------------------------------------
3. AutoDeConvolution
- read up and figure out what it is

-------------------------------------
4. Hypernetwork pruning
-  finish running experiments with the newer architectures and start to implement the hypernetwork

-------------------------------------
5. make a comment and send an email reply to kreo thanking them for the keyboard.

-------------------------------------
6. ~~buy the gift before lunch for amisha~~

-------------------------------------
7. check out value iteration as a solution for the adobe shit max problem

-------------------------------------
8. read the science of rapid skilll acquisition

-------------------------------------
9. make a philosophy of incredibly accelerated self improvement

-------------------------------------
10. make a summary of all the plots and present it to manish on slack and then figure out what the details and nuances are.

approach
how many videos
remaining after merging

TP - FP - FN - TN
precision@70recall
threshold



-------------------------------------
11. can hypernetworks trained as connectors on in-distribution connectors and data successfully connect quickly on just a few samples when the samples do not cover the test distribution properly?


-------------------------------------
12. figure out the reading list of linalg topics from jaisidh in whatsapp to be able to understand convergence proofs.

-------------------------------------
13. remember to write down everything manish says! he has too many windows open inside his head to remember the shit he tells to me.


-------------------------------------
14. add tablemaker into the script. it should generate the excel sheet somehow. think about how this can be done.


-------------------------------------
15. polymarket betting figure out how to do it. do the https://polymarket.com/event/will-israel-invade-syria-in-2024 and other related bets.

-------------------------------------
16. kelly criterion
read it and understand how to apply it by applying somewhere.



-------------------------------------
17. ~~figure out the du-sh on server and the other place.
- ~~match: ~~ <span class='red'> DONE </span>
	1. ~~`disksize.out`~~
	2. ~~`disksize2.out`~~
	3. ~~`disksize3.out`~~


-------------------------------------
18. resolve user-perms issue on 192.168.3.14


-------------------------------------
19. train ticket cancellation
- make sure that you are getting refunded
