# Guiding principles:
1. in life, it is **necessary to achieve escape velocity** even if it means sacrificing other stuff along the way. on a short-term timescale, **no schedule variation** should occur and everything should be watertight and optimised in order to achieve goals. however, on a long-term timescale, **favour the end** over intermediate goals. i cannot tie myself down with any commitments until 2026. this means no serious relationships, no seeking jobs and skills that do not add to my expertise directly, no picking up skills **unpurposefully**. Begin to accumulate and snowball **well-researched decisions and habits** that catapult you towards purpose.
2. **Action must come from a place of strength.** Winning at a disadvantage is inefficient and only for those who wish to inflame their ego at realising that you cant do everything in life. Weaknesses should be tended to until they are no longer bottlenecks for the truest test of your skill.
3. Divide the big goal into an yearly goal. Divide the yearly goal into quarterly goals. Divide the quarterly goals into monthly goals. Divide the monthly goals into weekly goals. Divide the weekly goal into daily goals. **END EVERY DAY WITH DECISION ON THE GOALS OF THE NEXT.**
4. Mistakes and unnecessary costs must be avoided with the help of mentors that are better. **Find a mentor who will treat you like a sponge**, kind of the same way that me and Rohan treated Shyam, or how Jaisidh treated me. This **HAS TO BE AN ORGANIC PROCESS**. Update - you failed to find a mentor for your work, 
5. All things must be treated as a draft. (cult of done)
6. Assessment, measurement and tracking of work is extremely important. (Andrew Tate)
	1. Numerical assessment
	2. Critical subjective assessment
	3. Social assessment

# Grand Vision
My grand vision for 2026 is to get to a frontier lab. My grand vision for 2028 is to make 8 figures $ a year. For this, it will be necessary to play to my overwhelming strength (competitive programming and machine learning) and amplify these while adding other key skills that complement them well. I can figure out my company or business or startup by the time we reach into 2026, especially if i have 2-3 good pubs by then.
I also realise that it will be much easier to reach these figures if I am not in India. However this is an uneducated guess and it needs to be questioned and thoroughly examined.


## Strengths (amplify)
- **critical thinking** - inverted thinking, rigor, the heart of all scientific knowledge.
- **machine learning** - intuition, pattern matching
- **obsession** - willingness to work harder and make more sacrifices for a defined goal.

## Weaknesses (convert)
These are important key skills that are bottle-necking my progress. They are worth giving a fuck about as they will be critical to my success once acquired and maintained, and become a hindrance without.
- **body language** - 70% of communication is nonverbal. important to understand as well as employ body language while communicating with others, else you are socially crippled.
- networking - you dont have a network neither do you know how to get one
- **money** - you dont know shit about money. its worth knowing how it works because you can make a shit ton of money with your skills as an algo trader. however this will require other skills such as web scraping mastery (can be learnt from a skilled person) and of course knowledge of money basics(idk??), the markets(samkit) , and trading insights (shaurya makkar). this will not be a small project.

## Weaknesses (stay away)
These are insecurities and passions that I cannot bother worrying about as they are not necessary enough towards either my goals or my overall well-being.
- **caprice** - have to become locked in on a short-term basis and gain skills purposefully to completion, just like jaisidh does. choose, and lock in. there should be no variation on a short-term basis to your actions. habit will make you efficient and more effective.
- respect - you will often not be respected or understood. take the example of anirudh. he gave zero fucks about respect. he was rarely understood because he was so locked into the pursuit of his goals and his own knowledge. his eventual results speak for themselves. and all this at the end of a lock-in period of just an year! amazing. but remember, in anirudh's words, "ishaan, tereko jo karna hai tu sab kar sakta hai bhai."

1 hr 30 min - bets
2 hr - gym
6 - 8 hr - sleep
0 - 2 hr - research / personal work
1 hr - reading
1 hr - personal care
1 hr - buffer period (chatting and shit)

# Weekends
just go ham bro. you have to measure how hard and long you can push here. lets see.



# GOALS

## Grand Vision
## Year

## Quarter
Do [MLAB](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/mlab) course and get jacked. and start applying. Get a raise or get ESOPs.

## Month

## Week 2
### Day 1
1. gym leg day -> maksad poora nahi hua
2. Figure out what yash should be doing in the car.
3. finish the repo release and then figure out how to make yolov8 run compatible with the rest of the framework. (avoid monkey patching, create new losess for this. modify the repo structure.)
4. Call vatsa at around lunch time
5. Start working on jaisidh work around lunchtime. Finish first iteration of work and run it today. Figure out forticlient and then bang shit out. bring laptop if need be.
6. Come back home by 7. Have dinner. Have meeting with agrima.
7. Write a note on how AI systems are not only capable of, but also bound to destroy civilization as we know it.
8. Journal a note on why exactly biological systems evolved to reward unsuccessful efforts.
9. Meditate for 30 mins
10. Sleep by 10:30
### Day 2
### Day 3
figure out the yolov8 implementation so far
give demo
start jaisidh work
### Day 4
backlogs - reading ghost wala thing that pravar gave
other stuff, find backlogs from elsewhere
## Week 1
### Day 5
- 
- make release - architecture.md and readme.md
- read ghostnetv2
- read the blog manish had sent earlier






### Day 4
yolov8 implementation

### Day 3
fix yolov3 bug, fix yolov7 bug, figure out the activations in all the models apart from yolov3

read goals from the other sheet and schedule important ones here

figure out and journal long term goals for the week

call vatsa

make excel sheet for tracking workouts and diet plan

start using the diet planner


### Day 2
pooped. tried to cover for day 1.
### Day 1
sim card switching, make excel sheets, make yolov7 compatible (deep work it out) -> after this, figure out the activations in all of the other models and fix,  run similar compatibility tests to check model loading wherever possible, read goals from the other sheet and schedule them into this one, take 1 hour of time to figure out the research direction and try to work on it after getting forticlient working, figure out yolov8 if the outputs are compatible or not, otherwise how to make them (use a writing pad and deep work it out) and then finally end the day by pondering over your HELL and HEAVEN and understand what it is they mean.


# Bets
1. no smoking
2. no vaping
3. journal every day
4. meditate 20 mins every day
5. call mom and dad every day
