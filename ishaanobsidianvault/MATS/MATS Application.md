# TODO
#ImportantTODO - Neel Nanda's list of Mechanistic Interpretability Prereqs
#ImportantTODO - familiarize yourself with sparse dictionary learning with AutoEncoders

- Read about transparent reasoning - https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/reasoning-transparency/ - what do you believe to be true, and your nuanced arguments for why?
- emphasise practicality - a willingness to write code and play around and get your hands dirty. Less than half your time should be spent reading papers.
- Do work that shows agency & creativity - "wow, i didn't think of that experiment, but it's a good idea"
- Setup a reminder on calendar to keep a watch out for Neel Nanda's summer cohort - he mentions it here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p-ggQV3vVWIQuCccXEl1fD0thJOgXimlbBpGk6FI32I/edit#heading=h.y0ohi6l5z9qn

### Reading list
- LessWrong
- The Precipice, The Alignment Problem, Human Compatible, Life 3.0, Superintelligence


# Ideas
- Safety test objection: an AI could be empirically tested in a constrained environment before being released into the wild. Provided this testing is done in a rigorous manner, it should ensure that the AI is "friendly" to us, i.e. poses no existential risk.
