### Getting yourself ready to have Quality Friends
1. Authenticity - don't act as if you are more than yourself, so that you attract people who are attracted to the real you.
2. Courage - be yourself. it's okay if you don't get along. it's unlikely everyone you meet will actually be compatible with you. Don't have insincere flattery. Find the people you are genuinely interested in, then win them over.
3. Have a good time with or without people.

	3. Innocent Question - easy. quick. dirty.
1. Conversations
2. Meeting IRL and Do An Activity Together
