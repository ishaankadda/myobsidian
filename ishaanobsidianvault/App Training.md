GENERAL TIPS:
- workflow: create a basic ass pipeline -> deploy MVP -> and train it on data from deployment
- dataset me kya type of data hona chahiye, think about that. filtering irrelevant stuff is good for accuracy. 
- your model decides your data / approach! LSTM use kiya ya transformer liya ya jo bhi. (kitne blobs aa rahe honge and then kya use ho raha hoga)
