This is a common approach to the training of a task that is difficult and demanding and cannot be **initially coped with.**
Under this approach, the whole task is **decomposed into segments.**
There are several strategies to decompose tasks - 
- segmentation - divide a task meaningfully across **time**.
- fractionation - breaking down task into **elements**
- simplification - reduction in **difficulty**

# Pitfalls
Training individual schemas has a negative transfer to performance on the whole task, as it is theorized that the main properties of schemas lie in the connections between them (which are not developed subsequently).
