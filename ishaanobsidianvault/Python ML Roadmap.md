# General Advice
Rule number 0: never listen to the advice of any one person. learn to listen to what a lot of wise people (who are where you want to be) think about their life, if they are happy, if you will be happy with that life, and then listen to their advice and then know that what they are saying is not necessarily true and you need to critically think about it.

Anyways,,

James Clear - Author of "Atomic Habits", one of the most well-known books on self improvement and building habits that stick. One of my favourite blogs from him - https://jamesclear.com/good-habits

**95% of what we do any day is habitual.** You wake up and brush your teeth and try to generally follow whatever your mom screams at you to do, etc. etc. and you don't need to think about these things, do you?

You scroll on your phone at every opportunity and waste your time on some addiction that you don't even like such as video games (simply because you have no self control and havent decided that you have other better things to do yet)

What if, instead of wasting your time habitually, what if you had habits that worked **FOR** you? What if you woke up and just naturally went outside, viewed the morning sunlight, made yourself the healthy breakfast you want, and then immediately got down to the biggest and most important task of the day i.e. your *mission* in life?

As we progress through phases of life, we find that we need to equip ourselves with different tools and habits adapted to the current state of the life we are in and the state of the life we want to head towards. The form the main meat of "who" you are, or your Identity, as well as the actual outcomes of what you do in a day.

1. **Understand where you can sustain your efforts and do more of those things.** It doesn’t matter if you start small because there will be plenty of time to pick up the intensity later. You don’t need to join a CrossFit gym, write a book, or change your entire diet at the very beginning. In the beginning, performance is irrelevant. Doing something impressive once or twice isn’t going to matter if you never stick with it for the long-run. **Only the things that you are going to do forever are going to matter to you.**
2. **Try many, leave with a few, repeat the best** - in life, understand that everything is a draft. Don't be a perfectionist and try to finish everything you start. Only stick to something if you are learning something by doing it. Also, learn to spot the signs of excellence quickly. For example, there are thousands of awesome books to read out there but 99% of them are not worth reading. 0.99% are worth reading once. 0.01% are worth reading a hundred times. In order to strike gold, you need to sift through a lot of bullshit and try a lot of things, and you don't have the time in life to complete everything you start and **also** have the luxury of the best quality. **In order to find quality, you need to deal with quantity.** *Actionable step - have a skeptical outlook on everything and critically analyse the merits and demerits and assess if it ticks all the boxes for you. The only way you can do this is by sampling it. For example, read the first few pages of a book or skim through the important bits in order to assess whether it is worth a read or not.*
3. **Set goals 10x harder than what you think you are capable of. Work 10x harder than is necessary to complete a task.** everything you do needs to have this sense of **urgency** about it. otherwise you either dont really need to do it or you are not putting in enough effort to learn whatever the lesson is in doing that thing. In life, most people don't work very hard and it is **stupidly** easy to crush these people just by choosing the thing you want to do and outworking everyone around you in it.
4. **Rush to practically implement new learnings, so that experience becomes coupled with theory.** example from my life - when I was dealing with a romantic interest, I usually read the preface of the book "The way of the Superior Man" before going out and meeting them. This would allow me implement whatever I felt I lacked in practical terms. This forms a very strong feedback loop for your learning and you learn very fast when you couple theory with immediate application this way. **A flipped perspective on this: Don't learn an entirely new skill just because it will help you get XYZ later. First get to experience XYZ itself and then decide whether you need to learn that skill or get that additional qualification.**
	(motivations to do something or learn something new can be valid if and only if: 1. you find a genuine deep sense of interest in doing it 2. it helps or allows you do something else that you find a genuine sense of interest in doing. Why only these 2? because, in life, there are infinite different possible things u can do. you can be a doctor, engineer, startup founder, beggar, shop owner, sweeper, firefighter, policeman, govt. employee, WHATEVER. the only thing that is important for you to achieve external and internal metrics of success is that you should be the best at whatever you are doing and you should derive a deep sense of joy from doing it. You can't work 16 hours a day in a field that doesn't interest you to begin with. And there is no way to crush your competition and ensure that you can earn a living doing something that you can't work on with that extreme level of energy every single day of the week.)
		



# Python Roadmap

# 0. Install Linux (optional) (ignore if not really interested)
Linux is really useful for machine learning and all sorts of programming stuff and it will help you identify with and relate to all sorts of programming nerds and geeks who know a lot of stuff about it.

# 1. Python (How to get started)
Google a 4 or 6 hour crash-course on Python. You will get various youtube videos on it and you just have to sit down for an entire day and do the whole thing in one stretch. Make any notes you want. Use notepad or Obsidian or a paper to make your notes but do note **WHAT PYTHON CAN BE USED TO DO.**
The purpose of doing the crash course is - it will give you a general idea of what the Python language is capable of, and whenever you are programming anything, you can just google the syntax for whatever it is that you want to program and then program it. If you have never learnt Python from anywhere, then you don't even know what to google, right? But, if you kind of have a general idea of how things work and what to google, then you effectively already know how to use Python.

That's all.

**Step 1:** install VSCode. Run your first hello world! program in python. 
**Step 2:** Follow the youtube guide below. Use VSCode to run everything.

# 2. Machine Learning Course

before the actual machine learning course, you should get a small idea of what it is.
