When humans first recognise an object, it takes time. After that, something interesting happens. They identify a set of patterns or heuristics that can be used to identify them in the particular setting. The process of recognition then gets satisfied so long as those heuristics are spotted.

How can we use this to make our pipeline more efficient?
1. expensive models do not need to be run all the time. Can alternate between expensive and cheap models for faster inference speed. **Problem: i dont actually understand the entire pipeline of application development for now.**
