shocking result right? yes sir
tomorrow most likely meta reviews

sir, should we think about where to submit this next?
few ideas


because you worked, they will not allow us to submit the paper anywhere. because this is a work that you did at iit jodhpur, you are only contributing to finish it to a level where you can submit. this is only continuation for a submission. **have to have some writing in place that allows me to work on this in my free**

email pe daal ke rakh lo. can also CC to MVatsa and Richa so that it is known ki ye hai. 
First and foremost important thing is to go and discuss with Manish on this.

Dr. Richa was also equally shocked. three possibilties;
1. go to next conference like **AAAI**. only catch is that we have to cut short the paper. 7 pages + 2 **diffusion model ke saath train karke dikhao** 
2. submit paper to WACV - something like Ishaan can't work on it and we continue onward like that only. Can simply convert the paper into WACV format after incorporating the rebuttal feedback. **1st round July 15th - ECCV conversion**, 15th August Deadline 1 month
3. More prestigious venue than TPAMI or Nature Machine Intelligence. Journals, but impactwise and reachwise highly reputed. **long time commitment**. multiple rounds of iterations. lamba, kabhi kabhi can take 2 years. **NMI faster than PAMI (only upto 7 8 months)**
4. given your time commitment, we can include as a third author a PhD student from the lab. The student can give us flexibility of trying to NMI.
5. **ICLR** - vatsa did not look at it, its September End.
6. Collaboration with Manish - IP sharing nahi kar sakte and we will have to have that in the MoU. agar understanding bas yahi hai ki hum sirf research publish karenge, then no problem.

# Conclusion
WACV se niche ka nahi dekhna.
