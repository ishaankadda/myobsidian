writing a paper entails => submitting a paper
the paper writing has to be sharp and adjusted and this will require supervision from vatsa and meetings. and constant work and awareness of the direction it is headed to.

and the work must be in one of two directions:
1. play around with the data until you figure out how to game the numbers. (lit review roughly 10 papers worth, writing and shit)
2. implement diffusion onto this shit. which i am not capable of atleast in the short term. => learn diffusion (read the paper and implement it from scratch), lit review in a similar vein (roughly 20 papers worth), and then figure out how to fucking make it work????????? bro how the fuck. this will require several hours a day.

lets say i wake up at 6 and finish the whole gym thing and am back by 8. bath and shit till 8:30 and then work till 10:30 and then go to office, come back at 7:20 and work 2 more hours until 9:20. then i sleep from 11 to 6.
